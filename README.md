# Sugarcane Leaf Disease Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of sugarcane leaf images used for detecting various diseases affecting sugarcane crops. The dataset is hosted on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nuruzzamankallol/sugarcane-leaf-disease).

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of images of sugarcane leaves categorized into different classes based on the type of disease. This dataset can be used for training machine learning models for image classification and disease detection in sugarcane plants.

### Classes

The dataset includes the following classes:
- Healthy
- Mosaic
- Red Rot
- Rust
- Yellow

### Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following structure:

sugarcane-leaf-disease/
├── healthy/
├── Mosaic/
├── Red_Rot/
├── Rust/
├── Yellow/



Each subdirectory contains images of sugarcane leaves belonging to the respective class.

## Usage
